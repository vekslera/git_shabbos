Git Shabbos is a compact app which helps you to painlessly finish you coding week. 
It will add all your unstaged files to the current git branch, commit them and push to the origin if exists.
Some useful properties:
1. Works under either Windows or Linux (will be extended to MacOS in the future).
2. Runs from a CLI: Terminal, Command Prompt, Power Shell etc.
3. Will allow for adding options (in the upcoming versions) in a Linux-style format, that is, as --<option> or -<letter>
4. The functionality: 
    4.1. In the current folder, look for a .git repo. 
    4.2. Use the current branch.
    4.3. Add (stage) all the modified files to the repo.
    4.4. Commit with a default message "git Shabbos!"
    4.5. Push to a remote origin if available.
5. Important options and extensions are coming soon!
